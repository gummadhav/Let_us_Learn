# Let_us_Learn

I wrote a tutorial for people who donot have access to GPU but want to learn CUDA programming. 
Along with that if you are interested to learn OpenCV programming, I show how to install OpenCV on Google Colab.
You can copy this ".ipynb" file and start programming in C++ with OpenCV and CUDA.
Ofcourse we can write Python code in Google Colab, but to be able to learn bare metal programming is better for performance.
